## <a id="Project-header"></a>Project Proposal

We decided to look at two datasets for YouTube viewing statistics in the UK with a view for creating and cleaning two tables to make a database ready for usage in PostGres. The Dataset we chose contained the top trending videos on the platform with up to 200 listed per day.

## <a id="Project-header"></a>Sources of the Data

We used a CSV and JSON file from Kaggle linked here:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new

We decided to use these files because it contained a large amount of data 
Data Extraction

We used the following files linked below, we also have a copy of the raw data in the ££££££ folder. 


## <a id="Project-header"></a>Data Transformation

First Step - Importing libraries into Jupyter Notebook
Loaded the csv file and transformed into a DataFrame
When looking at this we decided to drop any irrevelant columns. Looking at the data and the columns we decided to drop the publish_time, trending_date, thumbnail_link and some of the other columns we rendered unimportant.
Add a snapshot of the notebook here
Display the amended dataframe here with the trimmed down columns
We then decided to make it cleaner by changing the column names
Checked if there were duplicates
