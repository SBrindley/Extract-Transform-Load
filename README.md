Group 2's Project
First Step - Importing libraries into Jupyter Notebook
Loaded the csv file and transformed into a DataFrame
When looking at this we decided to drop any irrevelant columns. Looking at the data and the columns we decided to drop the publish_time, trending_date, thumbnail_link and some of the other columns we rendered unimportant.
Add a snapshot of the notebook here
Display the amended dataframe here with the trimmed down columns
We then decided to make it cleaner by changing the column names
Checked if there were duplicates
